# fusion_tables
Materials (including data) for a workshop on Google Fusion Tables. The data is from Indiana University's Cushman Collection of photographs, located [here] (https://github.com/iulibdcs/cushman_photos). I've cleaned the data up, geolocated it to the city level, and restricted it to the records from 1938 to 1952, just to make it easier to work with. I've also included a Markdown version of the handout (fusiontables.md) and an HTML version of the workshop handout, just in case you like viewing it that way.
